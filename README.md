   - Admin Password - Listed as "Admin password" on the back of your gateway, unless you have changed it.

## Usage

### Entities
Several types of entities are provided:
- `Simple Sensor Entities` provide a single piece of data, such as 5G cell signal quality.
- `Aggregate Sensor Entities` provide one or more dict objects as attributes. These objects contain raw data from the gateway.
- `Select Entities` allow you to make changes to the gateway's settings by selecting from a list of choices.
- `Switch Entities` allow you to make changes to the gateway's settings by turning a feature on or off.
- `Editing Entities` allow you to create forms to edit a group of related settings together.


### Simple Sensor Entities
`Simple Sensor Entities` can be used directly on dashboards in cards such as the `Entities` card.

All entities begin with `T-Mobile`, which will be omitted from the "Friendly Name" here for brevity.

| Friendly Name       | Example State  | Description
| -------------       | -------------  | -----------
| `4G Antenna Used`   | Internal_omni  | Antenna currently in use for 4G
| `4G Bands`          | b2             | Band(s) currently in use for 4G
| `4G Bandwidth`      | 15M            | The Bandwidth of the band(s) in use for 4G
| `4G Cell Global ID` | 310260xxxxxxxx | The (E)CGI identifier of the cell in use for 4G
| `4G RSRP`           | -95            | The Reference Signal Received Power of the 4G signal
| `4G RSRQ`           | -12            | The Reference Signal Received Quality of the 4G signal
| `4G SINR`           | 2              | The Signal to Interference & Noise Ratio of the 4G signal
| `5G Antenna Used`   | Internal_omni  | Antenna currently in use for 5G
| `5G Bands`          | n41            | Band(s) currently in use for 5G
| `5G Bandwidth`      | 90M            | The Bandwidth of the band(s) in use for 5G
| `5G Cell Global ID` | 310260xxxxxxxx | The (E)CGI identifier of the cell in use for 5G
| `5G RSRP`           | -97            | The Reference Signal Received Power of the 5G signal
| `5G RSRQ`           | -11            | The Reference Signal Received Quality of the 5G signal
| `5G SINR`           | 7              | The Signal to Interference & Noise Ratio of the 5G signal
| `Gateway Uptime`    | 29.2           | The number of hours since the gateway was started


### Aggregate Sensor Entities
`Aggregate Sensor Entities` contain a group of related values as attributes. They can be viewed using the 
`Developer tools` `STATES` tab. To use values from these entities in cards on a dashboard, they must first be extracted into 
a `Template Entity`. See `Examples` below.

Identical values are available via Actions of a similar name. Actions have the advantage of not filling history unneccesarily. See `Actions` below.

All entities begin with `T-Mobile`, which will be omitted from the "Friendly Name" here for brevity.

| Friendly Name      | Example State | State Source | Description
| -------------      | ------------- | ------------ | -----------
| `Gateway`          | 5G Gateway    | Gateway Name | Detailed gateway device data
| `Gateway Clients`  | 29            | Client Count | Detailed list of all connected clients. Disabled by default.
| `Gateway Sim Card` | 5G Gateway    | Gateway Name | SIM card information
| `Access Point`     | TMOBILE-xxxx  | SSID Name    | Detailed access point (wireless, or Wi-Fi) settings. Disabled by default.
| `Cell Status`      | Bands: b2 n41 | Bands in Use | Detailed cell tower and received signal data. Disabled by default.

The `T-Mobile Cell Status` entity is particularly likely to bloat history, as it is somewhat large and changes very frequently.


### Select Entities
`Select Entities` allow you to make changes to the gateway's settings by selecting from a list of choices.

All entities begin with `T-Mobile`, which will be omitted from the "Friendly Name" here for brevity.

| Friendly Name            | Example Choices            | Description
| -------------            | ---------------            | -----------
| `Wi-Fi 2.4GHz Channel`   | Auto, 1, 2, 3              | Sets the channel used for 2.4GHz Wi-Fi
| `Wi-Fi 5.0GHz Channel`   | Auto, 36, 40, 44, 48...165 | Sets the channel used for 5.0GHz Wi-Fi
| `Wi-Fi 2.4GHz Bandwidth` | Auto, 20MHz, 40MHz         | Sets the bandwidth used for 2.4GHz Wi-Fi
| `Wi-Fi 5.0GHz Bandwidth` | Auto, 20MHz, 40HMz, 80MHz  | Sets the bandwidth used for 5.0GHz Wi-Fi

**Note: After changing any of these settings, the gateway will need some time to reconfigure to the new settings.
It is best to allow the gateway to settle before changing another setting. The gateway has settled when the `state`
of the select control matches the new value.**

A [custom:mushroom-select-card](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/docs/cards/select.md) 
is an example of a card that can show both the current state and the desired new state at the same time.


### Switch Entities
`Switch Entities` allow you to make changes to the gateway's settings by turning a feature on or off.

All entities begin with `T-Mobile`, which will be omitted from the "Friendly Name" here for brevity.

| Friendly Name    | Description
| -------------    | -----------
| `Wi-Fi 2.4GHz`   | Turn off the radio for 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. Disabled by default.
| `Wi-Fi 5.0GHz`   | Turn off the radio for 5.0GHz Wi-Fi. Disabled by default.

**Note: Turning off either radio disables Wi-Fi on that frequency. Do not turn off the Wi-Fi on the frequency you are currently using.
Only turn all Wi-Fi off if you have a wired connection to your gateway.**


### Editing Entities
Each time settings in the gateway are changed, the gateway takes some time to process the change and become stable again.
`Editing Entities` are special entities that allow you to make changes to several related gateway settings at the same time by presenting
the data in a form that is saved in a single action. This improves the user experience, since you no longer have to wait between changes 
if editing several fields at once.

By themselves these entites do not affect the gateway's settings. Only when the `Save` button is pressed will these changes be applied to the gateway.

The following entities are used for adding, deleting, and editing SSIDs within the gateway. Up to four SSIDs may be created.

All entities begin with `T-Mobile`, which will be omitted from the "Friendly Name" here for brevity.


| Friendly Name                  | Type   | Description
| -------------                  | ----   | -----------
| `Edit SSIDs`                   | Select | Select an SSID to edit. The next seven controls will be populated with that SSID's settings.
| `Edit SSID Name`               | Text   | Edit the SSID name.
| `Edit SSID Password`           | Text   | Edit the SSID password.
| `Edit SSID Encryption Version` | Select | Change the Encryption Version ("WPA2/WPA3" or "WPA2").
| `Edit SSID Hidden`             | Switch | Broadcast or hide the SSID.
| `Edit SSID Guest`              | Switch | Set SSID to Guest mode.
| `Edit SSID 2.4GHz`             | Switch | Turn on or off 2.4GHz mode for the SSID.
| `Edit SSID 5.0GHz`             | Switch | Turn on or off 5.0GHz mode for the SSID.
| `Edit SSID Save`               | Button | Save all pending changes to the gateway.
| `Edit SSID Cancel`             | Button | Cancel all pending changes and display current gateway settings for the SSID.
| `Edit SSIDs Add`               | Button | Add a new SSID, up to four. A suggested name and password are provided.
| `Edit SSIDs Delete`            | Button | Delete the selected SSID. The first SSID cannot be deleted.

These entities can be used individually, as long as an SSID is selected using `T-Mobile Edit SSIDs` and the 
`T-Mobile Edit SSID Save` button is then "pressed" to apply any changes. However, they are best used together 
in a custom form, and will not be automatically added to dashboards. See `Examples` below.

**Note: `T-Mobile Edit SSID Password` will display each SSID's password in free text for anyone using your Home Assistant instance to see. 
If this is an issue in your environment, go to the `Settings\Devices & services\Entities` tab, find the entity, and edit it to clear the `Enabled` 
switch. However, the editing of SSIDs will no longer work properly.**

### Actions

`Actions` are available to control the gateway and to display gateway information.

All actions begin with `T-Mobile Home Internet`, which will be omitted from the "Action Name" here for brevity.

| Action Name                           | Description
| -------------                         | -----------
| `Reboot Gateway`                      | Reboot T-Mobile Home Internet Gateway
| `Set 2.4GHz Wi-Fi Transmission Power` | Set 2.4GHz Wi-Fi transmission power level on T-Mobile Home Internet Gateway
| `Set 5.0GHz Wi-Fi Transmission Power` | Set 5.0GHz Wi-Fi transmission power level on T-Mobile Home Internet Gateway
| `Enable/disable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi`         | Enable/disable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi on T-Mobile Home Internet Gateway
| `Enable/disable 5.0GHz Wi-Fi`         | Enable/disable 5.0GHz Wi-Fi on T-Mobile Home Internet Gateway
| `Get Client List`                     | Returns a list of all clients known to the T-Mobile Home Internet Gateway
| `Set Client Hostname`                 | Sets the hostname for a client locally in the integration
| `Clear Client Hostname`               | Clears a previously set hostname for a client
| `List Client Hostnames`               | Lists all manually set hostnames
| `Get Gateway`                         | Gets gateway device details
| `Get Gateway Clients`                 | Gets gateway wired and wireless clients
| `Get Gateway SIM Card`                | Gets SIM card details
| `Get Access Point`                    | Get access point (wireless) settings
| `Get Cell Status`                     | Get cell connection status

`Get Client List` can be used to return the entire list of wired and wireless clients in a single list for easy display
(the gateway splits clients into 2.4GHz, 5.0GHz, and Wired groups, as returned by `Get Gateway Clients`).

Often the gateway will be unable to obtain a useful hostname from a client. `Set Client Hostname` can be used to manually
save preferred hostnames to make viewing the client list more useful. `Get Client List` will automatically substitute the 
alternate hostname.

Note that these hostnames are only stored in the integration, and will not be passed back to the gateway or client device.

`List Client Hostnames` can be used to show which clients have had an alternate hostname provided by `Set Client Hostname`.

`Clear Client Hostname` can be used to remove one or all alternate hostnames. Using `Set Client Hostname` with a blank
hostname will also clear the hostname for a device.

`Get Gateway`, `Get Gateway Clients`, `Get Gateway SIM Card`, `Get Access Point`, and `Get Cell Status` return data that
is identical to that provided by the aggregate sensor entities above, but without filling history.

Actions are useful for populating a table (see table example below), while aggregate sensor entities are useful for creating template
sensors (see template example below).

[See sample action responses](docs/example-action-responses.md).

## Examples

### Create a Template Entity to monitor the gateway's software version

To extract the `softwareVersion` value from the `device` attribute in the `sensor.t_mobile_gateway` entity, 
create a Template Sensor Helper or add this to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "T-Mobile Software Version"
        unique_id: t_mobile_home_internet_softwareVersion
        state: '{{ state_attr("sensor.t_mobile_gateway","device")["softwareVersion"] }}'
```

Note that the `T-Mobile Gateway` entity must be enabled for this to work. Go to the `Settings\Devices & services\Entities` tab, 
find the entity, and edit it to set the `Enabled` switch.

### Display and edit a list of clients known to the gateway in a table

The gateway's client list can be conveniently displayed by using a [custom:flex-table-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/flex-table-card).

The latest release of the card allows editing and calling actions. These features can be used to easily maintain the list of
hostnames where the gateway was unable to provide a useful name.

This sample configuration uses the `Get Client List` action to populate a table with client details, and the `Set Client Hostname`
action after an edit to override the default hostname provided by the gateway.
It also allows text in cells to be selected for copying to the clipboard:

```yaml
type: custom:flex-table-card
title: T-Mobile Home Internet Clients
action: tmobile_home_internet.get_client_list
entities:
  include: sensor.t_mobile_gateway
sort_by: IP Address
selectable: true
columns:
  - name: Name
    data: clients.name
    edit_action:
      action: perform-action
      perform_action: tmobile_home_internet.set_client_hostname
      data:
        mac_address: cell[2]
        hostname: cell[0]
  - name: IP Address
    data: clients.ipv4
  - name: MAC Address
    data: clients.mac
  - name: Interface
    data: clients.interface
  - name: Connected
    data: clients.connected
    modify: "x ? 'Yes' : 'No'"
  - name: Signal
    data: clients.signal
    modify: x || 'N/A'
```

### Display a form to edit SSIDs

The `Editing Entities` described above can be displayed in a form to allow adding, deleting, and editing of SSID settings.
The following is a card definition that uses no custom cards.

To use the definition, add a new `Vertical stack` card to a dashboard view and select `SHOW CODE EDITOR`. Paste the definition below over
the existing text and `SAVE`. Your card should look something like this once you select an SSID:
